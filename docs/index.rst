Can carbon-client-js be installed with npm ?

carbon-client-js is actually written in Node.js but has been exported to a pure JavaScript library that can be used in browsers.
That being said, it can still be installed with npm, however, for Node.js, there is an extension for this client (:ref:`carbon-client-node <carbon-client-node>`) with more Node.js abilities.
