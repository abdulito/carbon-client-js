# Think about timeouts

# Moves tests into a "test" folder and user assert. i.e. make them real test cases.

# Change signature for get/post/etc... to be
get(params, options, cb)


# Support json params flag where it passes query string as ?name="abdul" if it was set. This will make ObjectServer
be able to parse params as a json without the need for type conversion

# Kill apiKey shit. We will bring it back with an authenticator

# Allow global options level:
   - Timeout. default 30 secs
